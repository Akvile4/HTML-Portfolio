    Coroline
</h3>

<p>
    This is the best animated movie of all time. It's a bit scary as for kids, but absolutely worth watching. The graphics are fantastic and the amount time spent to make this movie is insane!<br />

    IMDB Rating: 7.7/10

    The Dressmaker
</h3>

<p>
    This is one of the best movies of all time. It has everything in it: a lot of drama, thriller, a little bit of horror, some comedy bits and my favourite part - detective. But I am lying, the best part is has Kate Winslet in it and she is absolutely amazing!<br />

    Harry Potter SAGA
</h3>

<p>
    I love all Harry Potter movies and I can watch them again and again. We have a Christmas tradition to watch all movies but sometimes we do that even in the summer. They are just so amazing and even they are family movies they have quite a lot of darkness in them! <br />
